          <h2>MEME</h2>
          <p>Herrington gained fame in Japan as an Internet meme, after a clip from one of his videos, Workout: Muscle Fantasies 3, was posted on Niconico, a Japanese video sharing website, on August 10, 2007. Thousands of mash-up parody videos of him have been made, many of which utilize deliberate mishearings (soramimi) of lines from his films. He is affectionately called "Aniki" among the Nico Nico Douga community, and most of his videos are deliberately mistagged with "Wrestling Series".</p>
